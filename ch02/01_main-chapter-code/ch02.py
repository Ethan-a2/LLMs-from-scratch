# ## 2.1 Understanding word embeddings

# - No code in this section

# - There are many forms of embeddings; we focus on text embeddings in this book

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/02.webp" width="500px">

# - LLMs work with embeddings in high-dimensional spaces (i.e., thousands of dimensions)
# - Since we can't visualize such high-dimensional spaces (we humans think in 1, 2, or 3 dimensions), the figure below illustrates a 2-dimensional embedding space

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/03.webp" width="300px">

# ## 2.2 Tokenizing text

# - In this section, we tokenize text, which means breaking text into smaller units, such as individual words and punctuation characters

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/04.webp" width="300px">

# - Load raw text we want to work with
# - [The Verdict by Edith Wharton](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Verdict) is a public domain short story

# #### Troubleshooting SSL certificate errors
# 
# - Some readers reported seeing ssl.SSLCertVerificationError: `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` when running `urllib.request.urlretrieve` in VSCode or Jupyter. 
# - This usually means Python's certificate bundle is outdated.
# 
# 
# **Fixes**
# 
# - Use Python â‰¥ 3.9; you can check your Python version by executing the following code:
# ```python
# import sys
# print(sys.__version__)
# ```
# - Upgrade the cert bundle:
#   - pip: `pip install --upgrade certifi`
#   - uv: `uv pip install --upgrade certifi`
# - Restart the Jupyter kernel after upgrading.
# - If you still encounter an `ssl.SSLCertVerificationError` when executing the previous code cell, please see the discussion at [more information here on GitHub](https://github.com/rasbt/LLMs-from-scratch/pull/403)

with open("the-verdict.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:

print(raw_text[:99])


# - The goal is to tokenize and embed this text for an LLM
# - Let's develop a simple tokenizer based on some simple sample text that we can then later apply to the text above
# - The following regular expression will split on whitespaces

# In[4]:


import re

text = "Hello, world. This, is a test."
result = re.split(r'(\s)', text)

print(result)


# - We don't only want to split on whitespaces but also commas and periods, so let's modify the regular expression to do that as well

# In[5]:


result = re.split(r'([,.]|\s)', text)

print(result)


# - As we can see, this creates empty strings, let's remove them

# In[6]:


# Strip whitespace from each item and then filter out any empty strings.
result = [item for item in result if item.strip()]
print(result)


# - This looks pretty good, but let's also handle other types of punctuation, such as periods, question marks, and so on

# In[7]:


text = "Hello, world. Is this-- a test?"

result = re.split(r'([,.:;?_!"()\']|--|\s)', text)
result = [item.strip() for item in result if item.strip()]
print(result)


# - This is pretty good, and we are now ready to apply this tokenization to the raw text

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/05.webp" width="350px">

# In[8]:


preprocessed = re.split(r'([,.:;?_!"()\']|--|\s)', raw_text)
preprocessed = [item.strip() for item in preprocessed if item.strip()]
print(preprocessed[:30])


# - Let's calculate the total number of tokens

# In[9]:


print(len(preprocessed))


# ## 2.3 Converting tokens into token IDs

# - Next, we convert the text tokens into token IDs that we can process via embedding layers later

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/06.webp" width="500px">

# - From these tokens, we can now build a vocabulary that consists of all the unique tokens

# In[10]:


all_words = sorted(set(preprocessed))
vocab_size = len(all_words)

print(vocab_size)


# In[11]:


vocab = {token:integer for integer,token in enumerate(all_words)}


# - Below are the first 50 entries in this vocabulary:

# In[12]:


for i, item in enumerate(vocab.items()):
    print(item)
    if i >= 50:
        break


# - Below, we illustrate the tokenization of a short sample text using a small vocabulary:

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/07.webp?123" width="500px">

# - Putting it now all together into a tokenizer class

# In[13]:


class SimpleTokenizerV1:
    def __init__(self, vocab):
        self.str_to_int = vocab
        self.int_to_str = {i:s for s,i in vocab.items()}
    
    def encode(self, text):
        preprocessed = re.split(r'([,.:;?_!"()\']|--|\s)', text)
                                
        preprocessed = [
            item.strip() for item in preprocessed if item.strip()
        ]
        ids = [self.str_to_int[s] for s in preprocessed]
        return ids
        
    def decode(self, ids):
        text = " ".join([self.int_to_str[i] for i in ids])
        # Replace spaces before the specified punctuations
        text = re.sub(r'\s+([,.?!"()\'])', r'\1', text)
        return text


# - The `encode` function turns text into token IDs
# - The `decode` function turns token IDs back into text

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/08.webp?123" width="500px">

# - We can use the tokenizer to encode (that is, tokenize) texts into integers
# - These integers can then be embedded (later) as input of/for the LLM

# In[14]:


tokenizer = SimpleTokenizerV1(vocab)

text = """"It's the last he painted, you know," 
           Mrs. Gisburn said with pardonable pride."""
ids = tokenizer.encode(text)
print(ids)


# - We can decode the integers back into text

# In[15]:


tokenizer.decode(ids)


# In[16]:


tokenizer.decode(tokenizer.encode(text))


# ## 2.4 Adding special context tokens

# - It's useful to add some "special" tokens for unknown words and to denote the end of a text

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/09.webp?123" width="500px">

# - Some tokenizers use special tokens to help the LLM with additional context
# - Some of these special tokens are
#   - `[BOS]` (beginning of sequence) marks the beginning of text
#   - `[EOS]` (end of sequence) marks where the text ends (this is usually used to concatenate multiple unrelated texts, e.g., two different Wikipedia articles or two different books, and so on)
#   - `[PAD]` (padding) if we train LLMs with a batch size greater than 1 (we may include multiple texts with different lengths; with the padding token we pad the shorter texts to the longest length so that all texts have an equal length)
# - `[UNK]` to represent words that are not included in the vocabulary
# 
# - Note that GPT-2 does not need any of these tokens mentioned above but only uses an `<|endoftext|>` token to reduce complexity
# - The `<|endoftext|>` is analogous to the `[EOS]` token mentioned above
# - GPT also uses the `<|endoftext|>` for padding (since we typically use a mask when training on batched inputs, we would not attend padded tokens anyways, so it does not matter what these tokens are)
# - GPT-2 does not use an `<UNK>` token for out-of-vocabulary words; instead, GPT-2 uses a byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenizer, which breaks down words into subword units which we will discuss in a later section
# 
# 

# - We use the `<|endoftext|>` tokens between two independent sources of text:

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/10.webp" width="500px">

# - Let's see what happens if we tokenize the following text:

# In[17]:


tokenizer = SimpleTokenizerV1(vocab)

text = "Hello, do you like tea. Is this-- a test?"

tokenizer.encode(text)


# - The above produces an error because the word "Hello" is not contained in the vocabulary
# - To deal with such cases, we can add special tokens like `"<|unk|>"` to the vocabulary to represent unknown words
# - Since we are already extending the vocabulary, let's add another token called `"<|endoftext|>"` which is used in GPT-2 training to denote the end of a text (and it's also used between concatenated text, like if our training datasets consists of multiple articles, books, etc.)

# In[18]:


all_tokens = sorted(list(set(preprocessed)))
all_tokens.extend(["<|endoftext|>", "<|unk|>"])

vocab = {token:integer for integer,token in enumerate(all_tokens)}


# In[19]:


len(vocab.items())


# In[20]:


for i, item in enumerate(list(vocab.items())[-5:]):
    print(item)


# - We also need to adjust the tokenizer accordingly so that it knows when and how to use the new `<unk>` token

# In[21]:


class SimpleTokenizerV2:
    def __init__(self, vocab):
        self.str_to_int = vocab
        self.int_to_str = { i:s for s,i in vocab.items()}
    
    def encode(self, text):
        preprocessed = re.split(r'([,.:;?_!"()\']|--|\s)', text)
        preprocessed = [item.strip() for item in preprocessed if item.strip()]
        preprocessed = [
            item if item in self.str_to_int 
            else "<|unk|>" for item in preprocessed
        ]

        ids = [self.str_to_int[s] for s in preprocessed]
        return ids
        
    def decode(self, ids):
        text = " ".join([self.int_to_str[i] for i in ids])
        # Replace spaces before the specified punctuations
        text = re.sub(r'\s+([,.:;?!"()\'])', r'\1', text)
        return text


# Let's try to tokenize text with the modified tokenizer:

# In[22]:


tokenizer = SimpleTokenizerV2(vocab)

text1 = "Hello, do you like tea?"
text2 = "In the sunlit terraces of the palace."

text = " <|endoftext|> ".join((text1, text2))

print(text)


# In[23]:


tokenizer.encode(text)


# In[24]:


tokenizer.decode(tokenizer.encode(text))


# ## 2.5 BytePair encoding

# - GPT-2 used BytePair encoding (BPE) as its tokenizer
# - it allows the model to break down words that aren't in its predefined vocabulary into smaller subword units or even individual characters, enabling it to handle out-of-vocabulary words
# - For instance, if GPT-2's vocabulary doesn't have the word "unfamiliarword," it might tokenize it as ["unfam", "iliar", "word"] or some other subword breakdown, depending on its trained BPE merges
# - The original BPE tokenizer can be found here: [https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/src/encoder.py](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2/blob/master/src/encoder.py)
# - In this chapter, we are using the BPE tokenizer from OpenAI's open-source [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) library, which implements its core algorithms in Rust to improve computational performance
# - I created a notebook in the [./bytepair_encoder](../02_bonus_bytepair-encoder) that compares these two implementations side-by-side (tiktoken was about 5x faster on the sample text)

# In[25]:


# pip install tiktoken


# In[26]:


import importlib
import tiktoken

print("tiktoken version:", importlib.metadata.version("tiktoken"))


# In[27]:


tokenizer = tiktoken.get_encoding("gpt2")


# In[28]:


text = (
    "Hello, do you like tea? <|endoftext|> In the sunlit terraces"
     "of someunknownPlace."
)

integers = tokenizer.encode(text, allowed_special={"<|endoftext|>"})

print(integers)


# In[29]:


strings = tokenizer.decode(integers)

print(strings)


# - BPE tokenizers break down unknown words into subwords and individual characters:

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/11.webp" width="300px">

# ## 2.6 Data sampling with a sliding window

# - We train LLMs to generate one word at a time, so we want to prepare the training data accordingly where the next word in a sequence represents the target to predict:

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/12.webp" width="400px">

# In[30]:


with open("the-verdict.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    raw_text = f.read()

enc_text = tokenizer.encode(raw_text)
print(len(enc_text))


# - For each text chunk, we want the inputs and targets
# - Since we want the model to predict the next word, the targets are the inputs shifted by one position to the right

# In[31]:


enc_sample = enc_text[50:]


# In[32]:


context_size = 4

x = enc_sample[:context_size]
y = enc_sample[1:context_size+1]

print(f"x: {x}")
print(f"y:      {y}")


# - One by one, the prediction would look like as follows:

# In[33]:


for i in range(1, context_size+1):
    context = enc_sample[:i]
    desired = enc_sample[i]

    print(context, "---->", desired)


# In[34]:


for i in range(1, context_size+1):
    context = enc_sample[:i]
    desired = enc_sample[i]

    print(tokenizer.decode(context), "---->", tokenizer.decode([desired]))


# - We will take care of the next-word prediction in a later chapter after we covered the attention mechanism
# - For now, we implement a simple data loader that iterates over the input dataset and returns the inputs and targets shifted by one

# - Install and import PyTorch (see Appendix A for installation tips)

# In[35]:


import torch
print("PyTorch version:", torch.__version__)


# - We use a sliding window approach, changing the position by +1:
# 
# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/13.webp?123" width="500px">

# - Create dataset and dataloader that extract chunks from the input text dataset

# In[36]:


from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader


class GPTDatasetV1(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, txt, tokenizer, max_length, stride):
        self.input_ids = []
        self.target_ids = []

        # Tokenize the entire text
        token_ids = tokenizer.encode(txt, allowed_special={"<|endoftext|>"})
        assert len(token_ids) > max_length, "Number of tokenized inputs must at least be equal to max_length+1"

        # Use a sliding window to chunk the book into overlapping sequences of max_length
        for i in range(0, len(token_ids) - max_length, stride):
            input_chunk = token_ids[i:i + max_length]
            target_chunk = token_ids[i + 1: i + max_length + 1]
            self.input_ids.append(torch.tensor(input_chunk))
            self.target_ids.append(torch.tensor(target_chunk))

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.input_ids)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.input_ids[idx], self.target_ids[idx]


# In[37]:


def create_dataloader_v1(txt, batch_size=4, max_length=256, 
                         stride=128, shuffle=True, drop_last=True,
                         num_workers=0):

    # Initialize the tokenizer
    tokenizer = tiktoken.get_encoding("gpt2")

    # Create dataset
    dataset = GPTDatasetV1(txt, tokenizer, max_length, stride)

    # Create dataloader
    dataloader = DataLoader(
        dataset,
        batch_size=batch_size,
        shuffle=shuffle,
        drop_last=drop_last,
        num_workers=num_workers
    )

    return dataloader


# - Let's test the dataloader with a batch size of 1 for an LLM with a context size of 4:

# In[38]:


with open("the-verdict.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    raw_text = f.read()


# In[39]:


dataloader = create_dataloader_v1(
    raw_text, batch_size=1, max_length=4, stride=1, shuffle=False
)

data_iter = iter(dataloader)
first_batch = next(data_iter)
print(first_batch)


# In[40]:


second_batch = next(data_iter)
print(second_batch)


# - An example using stride equal to the context length (here: 4) as shown below:

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/14.webp" width="500px">

# - We can also create batched outputs
# - Note that we increase the stride here so that we don't have overlaps between the batches, since more overlap could lead to increased overfitting

# In[41]:


dataloader = create_dataloader_v1(raw_text, batch_size=8, max_length=4, stride=4, shuffle=False)

data_iter = iter(dataloader)
inputs, targets = next(data_iter)
print("Inputs:\n", inputs)
print("\nTargets:\n", targets)


# ## 2.7 Creating token embeddings

# - The data is already almost ready for an LLM
# - But lastly let us embed the tokens in a continuous vector representation using an embedding layer
# - Usually, these embedding layers are part of the LLM itself and are updated (trained) during model training

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/15.webp" width="400px">

# - Suppose we have the following four input examples with input ids 2, 3, 5, and 1 (after tokenization):

# In[42]:


input_ids = torch.tensor([2, 3, 5, 1])


# - For the sake of simplicity, suppose we have a small vocabulary of only 6 words and we want to create embeddings of size 3:

# In[43]:


vocab_size = 6
output_dim = 3

torch.manual_seed(123)
embedding_layer = torch.nn.Embedding(vocab_size, output_dim)


# - This would result in a 6x3 weight matrix:

# In[44]:


print(embedding_layer.weight)


# - For those who are familiar with one-hot encoding, the embedding layer approach above is essentially just a more efficient way of implementing one-hot encoding followed by matrix multiplication in a fully-connected layer, which is described in the supplementary code in [./embedding_vs_matmul](../03_bonus_embedding-vs-matmul)
# - Because the embedding layer is just a more efficient implementation that is equivalent to the one-hot encoding and matrix-multiplication approach it can be seen as a neural network layer that can be optimized via backpropagation

# - To convert a token with id 3 into a 3-dimensional vector, we do the following:

# In[45]:


print(embedding_layer(torch.tensor([3])))


# - Note that the above is the 4th row in the `embedding_layer` weight matrix
# - To embed all four `input_ids` values above, we do

# In[46]:


print(embedding_layer(input_ids))


# - An embedding layer is essentially a look-up operation:

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/16.webp?123" width="500px">

# - **You may be interested in the bonus content comparing embedding layers with regular linear layers: [../03_bonus_embedding-vs-matmul](../03_bonus_embedding-vs-matmul)**

# ## 2.8 Encoding word positions

# - Embedding layer convert IDs into identical vector representations regardless of where they are located in the input sequence:

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/17.webp" width="400px">

# - Positional embeddings are combined with the token embedding vector to form the input embeddings for a large language model:

# <img src="https://sebastianraschka.com/images/LLMs-from-scratch-images/ch02_compressed/18.webp" width="500px">

# - The BytePair encoder has a vocabulary size of 50,257:
# - Suppose we want to encode the input tokens into a 256-dimensional vector representation:

# In[47]:


vocab_size = 50257
output_dim = 256

token_embedding_layer = torch.nn.Embedding(vocab_size, output_dim)


# - If we sample data from the dataloader, we embed the tokens in each batch into a 256-dimensional vector
# - If we have a batch size of 8 with 4 tokens each, this results in a 8 x 4 x 256 tensor:

# In[48]:


max_length = 4
dataloader = create_dataloader_v1(
    raw_text, batch_size=8, max_length=max_length,
    stride=max_length, shuffle=False
)
data_iter = iter(dataloader)
inputs, targets = next(data_iter)


# In[49]:


print("Token IDs:\n", inputs)
print("\nInputs shape:\n", inputs.shape)


# In[50]:


token_embeddings = token_embedding_layer(inputs)
print(token_embeddings.shape)

# uncomment & execute the following line to see how the embeddings look like
# print(token_embeddings)


# - GPT-2 uses absolute position embeddings, so we just create another embedding layer:

# In[51]:


context_length = max_length
pos_embedding_layer = torch.nn.Embedding(context_length, output_dim)

# uncomment & execute the following line to see how the embedding layer weights look like
# print(pos_embedding_layer.weight)


# In[52]:


pos_embeddings = pos_embedding_layer(torch.arange(max_length))
print(pos_embeddings.shape)

# uncomment & execute the following line to see how the embeddings look like
# print(pos_embeddings)


# - To create the input embeddings used in an LLM, we simply add the token and the positional embeddings:

# In[53]:


input_embeddings = token_embeddings + pos_embeddings
print(input_embeddings.shape)

# uncomment & execute the following line to see how the embeddings look like
# print(input_embeddings)


# - In the initial phase of the input processing workflow, the input text is segmented into separate tokens
# - Following this segmentation, these tokens are transformed into token IDs based on a predefined vocabulary:
